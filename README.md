## How to install

**[Official Browser Extension](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/How-to-install-hacks)**

## Motivation

<details>
<summary><b>We aren't evil. Everything is open source, forever free, and without ads.</b></summary>
<br>
We're not trying to break the game because we're evil. We just wanted to help Prodigy become more secure, but they've ignored our emails and our requests to talk.

Because of that we're just publicly showing hacks! That, and it's also just fun ;)

All of our hacks are open source, and free. No paywalls, no ads, and no Patreon. If you really want to support us, you can Nitro boost our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/XQDfbfq)!
</details>



<details>
<summary><b>Legal</b></summary>

If you have any legal problems, please email support@prodigyhacking.com

## Disclaimer

<details>
<summary><b>Always use an alt just to be safe.</b></summary>
<br>
While our hacks are completely safe, <strong>you shouldn't use hacks on your main account</strong>.

There's an <b>extremely small chance your account will be hacker-tagged, reset, or banned</b>. Luckily, it almost never happens. The only incidents PMGH knows of users being banned for hacking were contributors or staff of PMGH itself.

We will <b>never<b/> ask you for your password. If somebody asks you for personal/sensitive information, report it to the staff on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XQDfbfq). (There <b>is<b/> an exception with our arena point website, but still use with caution)

All of our hacks are *open-source*, and only located under our [Github Organization](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking).
*If it's not an official repository, or a fork, it may not be safe!*

<details>
<summary><b>We're not liable for damage to your account.</b></summary>
<br>
- All hacks, exploits, or other files hosted here may damage your account if used improperly or excessively. We can't stress enough, do not use <i>any</i> of these hacks on your primary account, as you risk your account becoming damaged beyond repair, preventing you from accessing Prodigy Math Game in that account. You have been warned.
<br>
- We are not liable for any damages of any kind, as our license states:

> Limitation of Liability
> Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
